             <p>I was born in Australia in 1999. My father was born in Australia,
                 and my mother was born in New Zealand (Māori). I grew up living 
                 between my father’s house in Melton and my mother’s home in Alexandra
                 (rural country). I found the country life very interesting, I had
                 great friends and loved going to school there.  

                 Back in Melton, I left school during year twelve to pursue a career
                 in trades, including plumbing, electrical work and carpentry. 
                 After several years in a few different apprentice roles, I decided 
                 that it wasn’t for me, and began looking elsewhere for my passion.
                 I trialed several different courses, including education and nursing,
                 however due to enrollment issues I didn’t pursue those pathways.
                 A few years ago, I joined City on a Hill church, and began exploring
                 questions of faith. I got engaged last year and am planning to 
                 get married in the near future. I see a career in IT as a means 
                 to achieve job security in a field that is constantly evolving, 
                 and therefore will always be interesting and challenging for me.  </p>
