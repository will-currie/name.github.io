         <h3>What do the results means to me? </h3>
         <p>I think these tests, although might not be completely accurate, help
             to give inside into how someone might react to situations. Firstly,
             I think the 16 Personalities test is decently accurate - after 
             taking the multiple times to confirm the accuracy. I always arrived
             at the same result ISTP-A. I do think this personality type suits
             me quite well, as someone who's quite laid back and relaxed but
             also focused and gives everything my all.  
 
             My result (tactile) from the learning style test wasn’t surprising 
             to me. However, I did find it interesting that some of the things I
            
             do to help me study were also mentioned in the list (such as doing 
             something physical like gripping a stress ball or walking back and forth).
             There are also plenty of other good ideas on the list that I will
             definitely try in the future.  
            
             Lastly, while the last psychometric test was short (only displaying 
             two results), I would say that the results are still overall pretty 
             close to what I’d personally rate myself. I do find I have confidence
             in my work and I do push myself a little extra just to achieve certain
             goals. Overall, I think these tests are decently accurate and give you
             at least a small window into someone's personality and behavior without
             having actually met them. </p>

        <h3>How do these results influence your behavior in a team? </h3>

        <p>I think these tests outline my strengths which would be good for working
             in teams. For example, being goal driven, optimistic, rational and
             good in a crisis situation. I do think that being more of a tactile
             learner could be a challenge, especially online where I will have
             to mostly remain seated at my computer desk and discuss ideas/projects
             through discord or zoom. I also tend to get bored when working on
             the same issue for long periods of time, with no significant change,
             which can also make working in teams a bit of a struggle when I find
             it harder to assist on certain issues that aren't being resolved.
             However, with the help of my fellow team members I'm sure that we
             can push through these smaller issues and focus on the goal we want
             to achieve. </p>
        <h3>How should you apply this when forming a team? </h3>
        <p>I think when forming a team, I would work better with people who are
             similar to me in the ways that our strengths are similar - like 
             they want to buckle down and start the work in a timely manner. 
             However, I also feel that working with people who are different from
             me would be more useful in an online setting where we are meeting
             over programs such as zoom or discord. They may be able to offer 
             certain advantages such as: </p>

        <p> - Being able to maintain focus on the same task for a long period of time without getting bored or tired </p>
            
        <p> - Being able to encourage others and notice when they need some encouragement, and </p>
            
        <p> - Being more of a visual or auditory leaner </p>

        <p>When it really comes down to it, I think that the most important 
             part is communication between everyone to make sure we are all on 
             the same page and that no one is getting left behind. </p>
