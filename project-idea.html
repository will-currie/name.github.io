        <h3>Overview: </h3>

        <p>There are too many cat owners that are unfamiliar with how to take 
             proper care of their cats, and this often leads to them being abandoned 
             at shelters. My application aims to prevent or reduce this. The 
             idea behind this project will be an application only be available
             on the iPhone 12, iPhone 12 max and the 2020 iPad. These devices
             will use the latest technology added, the LiDAR scanner.  

             The application will take a photo of a cat and will use the LiDAR
             3D modelling to render a model of the cat. From the model, it will
             be able to detect certain features and qualities of the cat, and
             use them to approximately determine the cat’s breed. This will
             be achieved by matching the image with a database containing 
             thousands of photos of different cat breeds, and their specific
             features associated with the breed - such as a calico specific 
             colour patterns or a Maine coons robust bone structure and tuft 
             along its ears. It will use this to not only tell you the breed 
             of the cat but also any special care the cat needs, any certain 
             medical issues the breed generally has, or any dietary requirement.  </p>
             
        <h3>Motivation:</h3>

        <p>Growing up I owned and interacted with a lot of cats - they were very
             important to me and I developed a fairly strong attachment to them.
             When I moved to the country, they made a huge impact on my life by
             providing companionship, as they do for many other people. There 
             are many people who live in isolation or merely have reduced social
             support networks, and the role of pets as companions is becoming increasingly common.  

             As more people start to own cats, people will need a more convenient 
             way to learn about their cats and their potential needs. This is due 
             to the fact that a lot of cats have very serious medical issues that 
             the average person would have no clue about, often including their new
             owners. The convenience of this application will help people ensure 
             their cats will be able to lead a healthy and happy life. </p>
             
        <h3>Description: </h3>

        <p>There are several important features of this product, including:</p>  

             <p> - LiDAR is an integral component of this product, this technology works
                via measuring distance by timing the travel of the light pulse. The 
                main function is to scan an image and generate a virtual 3D model. In
                 this case this technology will enable users to scan an image of their cats and generate these 3D models 
               </p>

             <p> - Accessibility – Despite LiDAR only being available on the latest 
                 iPhones and iPad it is a revolutionary technology that is sure to
                 soon be added to other mobile phone brands devices such as, Xiaomi,
                 Google, and Samsung. </p>
            
             <p> - Swift – This programming language is used to create a very accommodating
                interface for both young and inexperienced users. This language will
                 be a great asset to this product because of its ease of use and 
                 industrial level quality. It is commonly used by amateur programmers,
                 meaning that third parties could contribute to this project without
                 needing advanced skills in programming.</p>  
            
             <p>The LiDAR technology will enable assessment of the appropriate care 
                 instructions for your cat: </p>
            
             <p> - Breed Identification – Given that there are over 70 recognised breeds
                 of cats, it is very important to identify exactly which cat breed you
                 are dealing with. Even though cats can be generally divided into
                 categories, such as short-hair or long-hair, it is recognised that
                 there are small differences between individual breeds. For example,
                 Bombay cats and Exotic short hair share many similarities including
                 coat colour, eye colour and similar size, but can be distinguished
                 by the exotic short hair’s flat, round face. </p>
            
             <p> - Breed-specific Medical Issues – As will be discussed in further detail
                 in the Outcome section, being aware of a cat's specific medical issues
                 is crucial for the health and wellbeing of the cat. This particular 
                 feature of this product has implications for veterinary care - in 
                 improving the efficiency of the assessment and treatment process. 
                 For example, the breed Scottish fold is known for its “folded” ears, 
                 but this is caused by a lack of cartilage in the cats body which in 
                 turn can cause the cat to suffer from serious arthritis in the future
                 if not taken care of properly. </p>
            
             <p> - General Guidelines for Care – As it is commonly understood, most cats 
                 have unique personalities and preferences for different diets, different 
                 play activates, amount of exercise etc. While these may not be directly 
                 related to the health of the animal, it can have a significant impact 
                 on their quality of life. For example, breeds such as Persian and ragdoll
                 tend to be lazier and require less outdoor stimulation compared to 
                 Devon Rex or Egyptian Mau who generally require a lot more outdoor stimulation. </p>
            
             <p> - Dietary Requirements – Despite not being widely known, dietary requirements
                 can have a significant impact on cat's health, this can be seen through
                 signs such as the shine of their coats or the consistency of their 
                 feces. For example, certain exotic breeds such as caracals or servals
                 are strictly carnivorous and tend to have a preference to catch their
                 own prey where as more common breeds such as a domestic short hair 
                 can be feed a variety of meat, commercial cat food or small amounts 
                 of vegetables </p>
     
        <h3>Tools and Technologies: </h3>

        <p>The required software to develop the app would be Swift - the best 
             programing language for developing apps on the apple ecosystem, in
             conjunction with XCode. XCode is an IDE (Integrated Development System),
             which is Apple’s only official supported way to create apps and
             publish them to the app store. I would also need to use Realm - 
             a cross platform mobile database. Realm is better than its other 
             commonly used counterparts, such as SQLite and core data, in the way
             that it is faster and easier to use, making coding a lot simpler
             when it is used in conjunction with swift. </p>

        <h3>Skills Required: </h3>

        <p>To build this app in a way that would maximise efficiency, I am going
             to need to develop several new skills.  

             Firstly, I will have to learn how to cope with Swift. Swift is 
             probably the best language for developing software for the apple
             ecosystem, which currently is the only mobile brand with a LiDAR
             scanner. I will also need to learn how to use XCode and Realm, 
             to be able to create a smooth working app that can captivate the
             consumer and indicate professional development. I believe this
             project will require significant amounts of time and effort however,
             this process would enable me to develop the skills needed to learn
             the required coding languages, and be able to make this app a reality
             in the future. </p>

        <h3> Outcome: </h3>

        <p>If the app is successfully created and launched, I’m sure it would 
             become a staple on all cat owner's phones. It would make taking 
             care of and raising a cat significantly easier for the average 
             person. It would provide cat owners with access to a vast database
             of information, which they could use to take care of their cat,
             and diagnose any potential medical issues. This could ultimately
             extend their life expectancy.  

             I think if this app was created it could potentially revolutionise
             the veterinary world, as this technology could be applied to all 
             types and breeds of animals. In the future, it could even provide 
             a service where you can send a vet a 3D model of an injured animal,
             your own, or one on the side of the road, and they could facilitate
             faster diagnostic processes. Ultimately, this would provide a boost
             in the health and wellbeing of animals.  </p>
