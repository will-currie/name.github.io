        <h3>What is your interest in IT? </h3>

        <p>I'm interested in IT because it has been a huge influence in my life,
             through various forms such as video games and computers. I've been
             very fond of these since a young age, as the easiest way to make a 
             friend was to invite someone over to play video games.  

             I always had a particular interest in robotics, as well as the coding
             that goes on behind the scenes. There has been a huge boom in the
             field of IT recently, as correlated with advances in technology in
             general. As such, many new jobs and opportunities will come into
             existence.  </p>

        <h3>Why did you choose to come to RMIT? </h3>

        <p>Given that I had no previous background in IT, I took the time to research
             the different options for IT study, considering the entry pathways, 
             topics of study, and support networks. I also talked to friends who
             had attended RMIT in the past, and they gave fairly promising reviews,
             highlighting the student support and quality of lecture/tutorial content.</p> 

             <p>I came to the conclusion that this was a very suitable university for me, for several reasons:</p>
            
             <p> - it was a place where I would get the most out of my studies,</p>  
            
             <p> - I could really immerse myself into the work and get support if and when I needed it </p>
            
             <p> - The locations of the university meant it was easily accessible through public transport, and </p>
            
             <p> - The student support services like RUSU compass.</p>

        <h3>What do you expect to learn during your studies?  </h3>

        <p>I know that what I learn and take away from this course really depends
             on me and how much time and focus I put into the course. I'm hoping 
             that through studying hard and immersing myself into the work Iâ€™ll be
             able to have a deeper understanding of:</p>

             <p> - The current technology systems in the world</p> 
            
             <p> - How to participate and make the most of team environments</p> 
            
             <p> - How to create a prototype of a product based in information and communication</p> 
            
             <p> - How to write IT reports in a professional manner, and</p> 
            
             <p> - Coding languages and how to implement it into a real-world setting. </p>
